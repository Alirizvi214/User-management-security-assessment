# Security Assessment and Hardening Report

This document outlines all the security improvements made to the **User Management System** as part of a comprehensive security assessment and hardening project. The goal was to identify vulnerabilities, secure the application using industry-standard practices, and ensure its readiness for real-world deployment.

---

## Vulnerability Testing

Security testing was performed using both automated tools and manual methods.

### Tools Used:
- **Nmap**: Scanned for open ports and services
- **OWASP ZAP**: Scanned the web app for XSS, CSRF, and insecure configurations
- **Manual Injection Attempts**: Tested for SQL Injection, XSS, and cookie manipulation

### Findings:
- Vulnerabilities were found in input fields (XSS and SQL Injection)
- Missing secure headers
- Insecure cookie handling
- Lack of CSRF protection
- No event logging or audit tracking

---

## Security Features Implemented

### Input Validation and Sanitization
- All user inputs are validated using the `validator` library
- Scripts like `<script>` are filtered out to prevent XSS

### Password Hashing
- Passwords are securely hashed using `bcrypt` before saving to the database

### Authentication
- Implemented token-based authentication using `jsonwebtoken`
- JWTs are signed with a secret and include the user ID in payload

### Logging and Monitoring
- Used `winston` to log important application events like:
  - App startup
  - Successful and failed login attempts
  - Unexpected errors or suspicious behavior
- Logs are stored in a file named `security.log`

### Secure HTTP Headers
- Configured `helmet` to enable secure HTTP headers like:
  - `Content-Security-Policy`
  - `Strict-Transport-Security`
  - `X-Content-Type-Options`
  - `X-Frame-Options`
  - `Referrer-Policy`

### CSRF Protection
- Added CSRF protection using the `csurf` middleware to prevent cross-site request forgery

### JWT & Cookie Security
- JWTs are securely stored
- Cookie settings (recommended for production): `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite=Strict`

### Secure Data Handling
- Caching disabled via headers
- Sensitive operations are protected using secure routes and proper middleware

## Nmap Port Scan Summary

A local Nmap scan was conducted to inspect exposed services:

- Open Ports: `135`, `445` (system-level) and `3000` (application)
- No service version leaks were found
- Only necessary ports are exposed for app usage

## Credits and Notes

The original application was sourced from an open-source repository and assessed for educational purposes. All enhancements were built on top of the original codebase to improve its security readiness.
